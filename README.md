# CanSat Final Project - SSTLAB Course 🚀🌍

## Overview 📝
This project was part of the SSTLAB course, where I worked on the PCB and power design subsystem for a CanSat project. The aim of the CanSat was to detect pollution, measture the temprutere, height of the CanSat, pressure in the atmosphere, using various sensors and components to gather and transmit data.

## Project Components 🔧
The project involved three distinct PCBs, each with a specific role in the overall system:

- **PCB 1**: Power Supply and Voltage Regulator ⚡
- **PCB 2**: Microcontroller (ATmega328), MPU 🧠
- **PCB 3**: GPS, MQ-35 Gas Sensor, RF Transmitter 🌍💨📡

Each PCB was designed to interact with the others, with the power supply ensuring stable operation for all components, and the microcontroller handling sensor data and communication with the RF transmitter for data transmission.

## My Role 👨‍💻
I focused on the **PCB Design and Power System** aspects of the project. My main responsibilities included:
- Designing the PCB layout and ensuring efficient power distribution.
- Selecting and implementing the voltage regulator and power management components.
- Ensuring all components were properly powered for stable operation during flight.

## Tools Used 🛠️
- **DipTrace**: Used for PCB design and layout.

## Project Outcome 🎯
The CanSat was successfully designed to detect and transmit atmospheric data using a gas sensor (MQ-35), GPS for location tracking, and an RF transmitter for communication. The power subsystem ensured reliable operation of all components, and the PCB designs were finalized and prepared for fabrication.
