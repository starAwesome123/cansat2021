# 📡 CanSat Project – PCB Design

## 🛠 Project Overview
This project is part of a student-built **CanSat (Can-sized Satellite)** system. The mission was to measure atmospheric pollution and transmit data during descent. The system was divided across **three custom-designed PCBs**, each with a specific role.

## 🧩 My Role
**PCB Designer** – I was responsible for designing the PCBs using **DipTrace**, ensuring the circuit layout met power, sensor, and communication requirements.
